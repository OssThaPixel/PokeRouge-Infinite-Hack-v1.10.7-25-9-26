PokeRogue Infinite Egg Voucher Hack:
v1.10.7 25/9/26

When in the main menu press "M" to open the game menu and go to "Egg Gatcha"

In the gatcha page click “fn + f12” or “right-click + inspect”

Make sure to have "Pause on uncaught exceptions" and "Pause on caught exceptions" turned on

Go to "Sources" on the top bar

Go to the "assets" dropdown on the left and click "battle-scene"

Now click "ctrl+f" and type "vouchercounts"

Go down to 14 of 15 beside the search bar

Once there scroll down to "processTransitionInput(e)"

Put a breakpoint at the "}" above "processTransitionInput(e)" (click on the "-" icon beside the curly bracket)

Click back on the game and press "Z"

Once the game pauses go back to the debug, and go to "Console" at the top

Type in "allow pasting" in the console and hit "enter"

Then paste in this code (change the "#" to the amount of vouchers you want):

for (let i = 0; i <= 3; i++) {
  this.prompt.scene.gameData.voucherCounts[i] = #;
}

And click enter

Go back to the game and un-pause it with the blue arrow at the top

Now close the debug menu and reload the page.

Do this fast otherwise the game will open vouchers without you

If you did everything right when you check your egg vouchers you should have the amount you hacked in.

Good Job!

When you enter the code the console doesn't reply with the number you set, try:

1. turning on "Pause on uncaught exceptions" and "Pause on caught exceptions"

2. Turning on "allow paste" in the debug console

3. Removing the "#" in the code


If none of these work, maybe the hack has been patched out, check the version # in the starting menu.
